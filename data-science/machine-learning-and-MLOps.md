# Data Science X Machine Learning

Every machine learning project is a data science project, but not every data science project needs to involve machine learning!

## What is Machine Learning?

The first person to use the phrase “machine learning” was probably Arthur Samuel, who developed one of the first computer programs for playing checkers. In 1959, he defined machine learning as technology that gives “computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.” Other computer scientists have proposed more mathematical definitions for machine learning, but Samuel's definition remains one of the most accurate and easiest to understand.

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence, the segment of computer science that focuses on creating computers that think the way humans think. In other words, all machine learning systems are AI systems but not all AI systems have machine learning capabilities. You can subdivide machine learning into several different categories:

## Types of learning

**Supervised Learning** – Supervised learning requires a programmer or “teacher” who provides examples of what inputs align with outcomes. For example, if you wanted to use supervised learning to teach a computer to recognize pictures of cats, you would provide it with a set of images, some that were labeled “cats” and some that were labeled “not cats.” Machine learning algorithms would help the system learn to generalize concepts so that it could identify cats in images it had not encountered before, i.e. in new datasets.

**Unsupervised Learning** – Unsupervised learning requires the system to develop its own conclusions from a given set of data. For example, if you had a large set of online sales data, you could use unsupervised learning to find clusters or associations between that data that could help you improve your marketing. You might find, for example, that people born in the early 1980s with incomes exceeding R$5,000 per month have an affinity for a particular brand of chocolate bar, or that people who buy a particular brand of soft drink also buy a certain brand of chips.

**Semi-Supervised Learning** – Semi-supervised learning is a combination of supervised and unsupervised learning. Returning to the cat example, imagine that you have a large number of images, some of which have been labeled “cat” and “not cat” and some other images without labels. A semi-supervised learning system would use the labeled images to make inferences about which of the unlabeled images include cats. The best guesses would then be fed back into the system to help it improve its capabilities and the cycle would continue.

**Reinforcement Learning** – reinforcement learning involves a system that receives feedback analogous to punishments and rewards. A classic example of reinforcement learning (as it applies to machine learning) is an agent learning to play a game. The objective is to win the game and the agent is rewarded or punished according to his mistakes and successes, until he reaches his goal.

## Machine Learning Use Cases

1. **Fraud Detection** – Banks and credit card companies were among the first to use machine learning. They often use technology to identify transactions that may be fraudulent.

2. **Recommender Systems** – The online recommendation engines used by companies like Amazon and Netflix are among the clearest examples of machine learning. Using data collected from millions of shoppers and users, machine learning systems are able to predict items you might like based on your past purchases or viewing habits.

3. **arch Engines** – Google, Microsoft Bing and other search engines use machine learning to improve their capabilities minute by minute. They can analyze data about which links users click in response to queries to improve their results. They are also using machine learning to improve their natural language processing and provide specific answers to some questions.

4. **ideo Surveillance Systems** – Machine learning allows facial recognition systems to improve all the time. In some cases, these systems may identify known criminals, or may be able to identify behaviors or activities that are outside the norm or break the law.

5. **Natural Language Processing** – Today, most of us take for granted that personal assistants like Siri, Alexa, Cortana or Google Assistant will be able to understand voice requests and respond to questions. Over time, these tools use machine learning to improve your abilities to recognize, understand, and process verbal input.

6. **Customer Service Bots** – Automated agents can use natural language processing and customer service data to answer common questions and improve the quality of those answers over time.

7. **IT Security** – Many of today's most advanced IT security solutions, such as user behavior analysis tools, use machine learning algorithms to identify potential attacks. Machine learning establishes a baseline of “normal” behavior that it uses to detect anomalies, potentially allowing organizations to identify and mitigate threats.

8. **Data Streaming Analytics** – Organizations use machine learning to find insights or identify potential problems in real time.

9. **Predictive Maintenance** – The Internet of Things (IoT) offers many machine learning use cases, including predictive maintenance. Companies can use historical equipment data to predict when machines are likely to fail, allowing them to proactively make repairs or install replacement parts before it impacts business or factory operations.

10. **Anomaly Detection** – In the same way that machine learning can identify anomalous behavior in IT systems, it can also detect anomalies in manufactured products or food items. Instead of hiring inspectors to visually examine products, factories can use machine learning systems that have been trained to identify items that do not meet standards or specifications.

11. **Emand Forecasting** – In many industries, getting the right amount of product to the right location is critical to business success. Machine learning systems can use historical data to predict sales much more accurately and quickly than humans can on their own.

12. **Logistics** – For transport companies, setting up schedules and routes is a complex and time-consuming task. Machine learning systems can help identify the most efficient and cost-effective way to move goods or people from point A to point B.

13. **Financial Trading** – Every trader hopes to find patterns in the market that allow him to buy low and sell high. Machine learning algorithms can help identify potential opportunities based on past market activity.

14. **Healthcare Diagnosis** – Many experts envision a future in which machine learning diagnostic tools work alongside human professionals to identify illnesses and determine the most effective course of treatment. Computerized systems can be particularly good at detecting anomalies and consequently detecting rare diseases.

15. **Robots** – Although they have long been a staple of science fiction, robots with machine learning abilities could very soon be part of everyday life. These robots could improve their capabilities over time, allowing them to become more useful to humans.

## What is MLOps?

MLOps is defined as “a practice of collaboration and communication between Data Scientists and operations professionals to help manage the lifecycle of Machine Learning models in production. Similar to DevOps or DataOps approaches, MLOps seeks to increase automation and improve the quality of Machine Learning models while focusing on business and regulatory requirements.”

In short, MLOps represents all the pieces of engineering that come together and generally help deploy, run, and train AI models. From this, we can see that there are three tightly intertwined components of MLOps:

- Machine Learning;
- DevOps (IT);
- Data Engineering.

Each component contributes key elements that work to close the lifecycle of Machine Learning models in an organization.

With origins in developing practices used to help Data Scientists and DevOps teams communicate better using machine learning, MLOps allows you to create workflows and processes to manage the difficulties faced with Machine Learning.
