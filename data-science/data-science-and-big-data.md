# Data Science and Big Data

Many people confuse thinking that Data Science and Big Data represent the same thing, but no, Data Science comprises the set of techniques, tools and procedures for data analysis and Big Data is exactly our raw material, it is what we let's apply it to Data Science.

## What are Data?

Data are individual facts, statistics or measurements, which are collected through observation and/or measurement.

**Data** represents a very broad concept, in practice, everything that I can observe or measure and consequently collect, I can call Data.

ith the advent of computing, especially over the last few decades, we have been able to collect, store and process increasingly larger volumes of data.

In a more technical sense, data is a set of qualitative or quantitative variable values about events, people or objects.

Although the terms "data" and "information" are often used interchangeably, these terms have distinct meanings.

The data represents something still raw, that is, it is an individual fact, a statistic, it is a measurement, so I collect this data through observation, measurement, etc. to later analyze this data and then convert the data into information and later into knowledge, to help the decision maker.

In other words, data represents the most basic form of information. Before any processing, any analysis, what I generally have in my hands is the raw data, and the volume of data continues to grow, and is increasing in the form of volume, variety and speed, which is exactly the concept of Big Date.

## De onde vem os Dados?

- Medical procedures;
- Social media;
- News and Newspapers;
- Satellite images;
- E-commerce;
- TV and Video;
- Sensors and Monitoring Systems.

**What do I do with this Data?**

The first step is to collect the necessary data, the second step is to do the correlation work, that is, check if the data are related and then apply the analysis techniques and tools and finally deliver the insights.

## What does the Data represent?

- Entity;
- Characteristics;
- Environment;
- Event;
- Behavior;
- Result;
- Observation;
- Measurement;
- Assumption.

## Data and Information

**Data** are collections of facts, such as numbers, words, measurements, observations or even just descriptions of things.

Data can be any character, text, word, number, image, sound, or video and, if not placed in context, means little or nothing to a human being.

I collect this data and analyze, clean it and transform it into information.

The information is useful and formatted in a general way, allowing it to be understood by a human being.

**Example:**

Data: 55-21-9999-999, this data could mean anything, as it is without context.

Information: 55-21-9999-9999 is a personal telephone number, now there is a context and you can understand.

## What are Datasets?

- Data set.
- Collections of observations.
- Each observation is typically called a record.
- Each record has a set of attributes that point out characteristics, behaviors or results.
- Datasets can have one record and one attribute and there is no maximum limit.

## What about Big Data?

Everyone leaves "traces" when they create an account on a social network, watch a video on the Internet, make purchases online, etc.

Data such as purchase frequency, average consumption, number of likes on posts, searches, etc.

Multiply that billions of times and you begin to understand what Big Data is.

Big Data is a collection of large and complex data sets that cannot be processed by databases or traditional processing applications.

**Big Data is defined by four V's:**

- Volume;
- Variety;
- Speed;
- Veracity.

Big Data can be composed of data from different sources and different formats.

| | Data Format | |
|-|-------------------|-|
| Internal | Structured | Unstructured |
| | Research results, Sales records, Process control measures, Internal systems databases (ERP, CRM), etc. | Email, Letters, Text Messages, Video Captions, Customer Reviews, Voice Message, Images/Illustrations, Employee Reviews, etc. |
| External | Likes on posts, Post publication times, Updates, Score on rating sites, etc. | Content published on social networks, comments in online forums, images, videos from security cameras, etc. |

## Data Sciences and Big Data

Big Data is the Fuel for Data Science!

With the ever-increasing volume of data, we are able to extract patterns, detect anomalies, find correlations and make predictions in an increasingly accurate way.

Big Data was largely responsible for the growth of Data Science.

| ERP CRM BI SCM RS | Internal Data | External Data |
|-------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Social Media, Text Analysis, API's, Speech Recognition, Natural Language Processing, Internet of Things, Automation, Saas, PaaS | |
| | Structured, predictable, permanent, easy to obtain. | |
| | | Unstructured, Random, Volatile, Difficult to obtain. |

> We tend to overestimate the effect of a new technology in the short term and underestimate the effect in the long term. - Roy Amara

## What is Big Data Analytics?

Big Data Analytics is the application of Data Science to the analysis of Big Data.

With Big Data Analytics the objective is to solve business problems through analyzing data with high volume, variety and generated at high speed.
