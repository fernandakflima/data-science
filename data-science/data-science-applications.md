Business Intelligence and Data Science have a lot in common and Data Scientists and BI Analysts are like cousins. Both use data for the same purpose, but their approach, technology and function differ in several ways.

**Business Intelligence** - The objective of BI is to convert raw data into business insights, which business leaders and managers can use to make decisions.

**Data Science** - Data Science also converts raw data into business insights, but applies scientific methodology to data exploration, hypothesis testing, statistical modeling and machine learning.
