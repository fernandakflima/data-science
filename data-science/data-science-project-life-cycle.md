# What is a project?

The word *project* comes from the Latin word *projectum*, which means "before an action".

Over time, the meaning of "project" was modified and expanded, and today there are several types of projects, ranging from personal projects to highway projects, for example.

Making a plan before putting something into practice has become a priority and today there is a management discipline that is especially responsible for this: Project Management.

**A project is a one-time, temporary, progressive effort undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result.**

This means that a project is a specific action that has a determined beginning and end (it is, therefore, a temporary action), and a clear objective to be achieved within the resources that are allocated to it (financial, material and human). Generally, projects are divided into stages, which are executed to generate deliverables.

Projects should not have an indefinite duration or unlimited resources - both should be planned in advance to establish a baseline to follow.

According to the PMBOK Guide, the success of a project is measured by the quality of the product and project, punctuality, compliance with the budget and the degree of customer satisfaction.

In data science we work on different projects, to solve different problems in different business areas and with different tools.

## Main characteristics of a project

- Every project is unique;
- Has a defined beginning and end;
- It is progressive;
- Has limited resources;
- Has a clear and viable objective.

## Data Science Projects

Every Data Science project must start with the objective, that is, the questions that need to be answered.

After formulating the questions, the data that will help answer them is sought.

The maturity of the Project Management discipline allows good project management practices, such as those defined by PMI (Project MAnagement Institute), to be used in Data Science projects.

**Tips**

- Initially, it is vital to understand the problem to be solved.
- This may seem obvious, but business problems are rarely packaged neatly.
- Assessing and reassessing the problem and designing a solution is an iterative process of discovery.
- In practice, the biggest challenge in data science is identifying the problem.

**Life cycle**

Understanding the problem -> Understanding the data -> Data preparation -> Modeling -> Evaluation -> Implementation.

## Business problem definition examples

**Identifying the problem is one of the main tasks in a Data Science project!**

*Exercises*

**Who are the most profitable customers?** - This question can be answered with a simple query to a database, using SQL language, for example.

- I want to look at the past here, customers have already made the purchase, therefore I need history, Machine Learning does not apply here.

**Is there a difference between the most profitable customers and the average customer?** - We can use statistics and perform a hypothesis test with R language to confirm or reject our thesis that the most profitable customers have a difference in relation to the average customer.

- I would have to fetch historical data and put it in the storage system, then I would have to prepare this data. After generating and formulating a hypothesis test and looking for a function in the R language that could apply the hypothesis test to the data, I would have to calculate the average of the customers and with the result, I have the answer.

**Will any particular client be in the most profitable group? How much revenue can I expect from this customer?** - Here we could use exploratory analysis with the Python language to examine the customer's history and then use Machine Learning to create predictive models and predict whether the customer will be in the most profitable group, when this may occur and also predict future revenue from this client.

- I prepare the historical data, pre-process, feed a Machine Learning model, create some versions of this model, I can also create more than one model (if necessary) and then with this predictive model I am able to answer this question.

**Identifying the problem to be solved will impact the entire Data Science project, not only in relation to cost, but also in relation to the resources that will be adopted.**

## Data Science project life cycle

Every project will have four main stages:

**Planning**

- Understanding the business problem;
- Definition of the business problem;
- Knowledge of data.

Responsibility of the data science team with the business areas.

**Data engineering**

- Data acquisition and storage;
- Cleaning and transformation;
- Enrichment and persistence.

Responsibility of the data engineer/architect.

**Analytics**

- Exploratory data analysis;
- Statistical/predictive modeling;
- Inference and predictions.

Responsibility of the data analyst/scientist

**Production**

- Construction of data products;
- Data pipelines and Machine Learning pipelines;
- Continuous improvement.

Responsibility of the Machine Learning/Data Ops engineer

## Data Science project phases

Problem definition, Data, Exploratory data analysis, Modeling, Implementation, Communication

Exproatory data analysis, Questions, More data

It's a cycle, that is, it repeats itself.

## Generated products

*The quality of your outputs will be determined by the qualities of your inputs. Good results depend on asking good questions!*

- Reports;
- Graphics and Dashboards;
- Statistical/predictive models;
- Web Apps;
- Recommendation system.

## Data-Driven Culture

A company with a data-driven culture recognizes the importance of Big Data and Data Science to make better decisions and offer better products and services.

## Examples of Data Science projects

- Text analysis of reviews of items purchased online;
- Prediction of user behavior;
- Forecasting the performance of athletes or sports clubs;
- Marketing and social media analysis for hotel chains;
- Prediction of crimes and places of occurrence;
- Analysis and forecast of default rates;
- Recommendation systems;
- Prediction of flight delays;
- Analysis and classification of potentially malicious files;
- Detection of anomalies in financial transactions;
- A/B testing to compare the effectiveness of different product sales pages.
