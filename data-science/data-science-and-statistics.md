# Data Science X Statistics

In essence, data science involves the use of automated methods to analyze huge amounts of data in order to extract knowledge from the data.

Therefore, statistics and data science are not the same thing, statistics is a pillar, a discipline that we use in data science.

## [American Statistical Association](https://www.amstat.org/)

*"Through this statement, ASA and its members recognize that data science encompasses more than statistics, but at the same time also recognizes that statistics plays a fundamental role in the rapid growth of this field. It is our hope that this statement can reinforce the relationship between statistics and data science and also foster mutual collaborative relationships between all contributors to data science."*

In short, statistics plays a fundamental role within data science, but data science encompasses other areas of knowledge. Data science is a multidisciplinary area and statistics is one of its disciplines.

## Defining statistics

Statistics is a set of methods used to analyze data. It can be applied to practically all areas of human knowledge.

Statistics aims to help understand the events that surround us, providing tools capable of improving our decision-making process in an environment of variations and uncertainties.

Statistics is present in all areas that involve planning experiments, building models, collecting data, processing and analyzing data, and their consequent transformation into information, to postulate, refute, or validate scientific hypotheses about an observable phenomenon.

In this way, statistics can be thought of as the science of learning from data.

In general terms, we can say that statistics provides data analysis techniques and methods that assist the decision-making process in the most varied problems where uncertainty exists.

The statistics are present in:

- Biostatistics;
- Accounting;
- Quality control;
- Commercial statistics;
- Economic statistics;
- Engineering statistics;
- Physical statistics;
- Population statistics;
- Psychological statistics;
- Social statistics;
- Geostatistics;
- Operational Research;
- Process analysis.

## Three major areas of statistics

**Probabilidae** - Study of randomness and uncertainty.

**Descriptive Statistics** - Uses methods for collecting, organizing, presenting, analyzing and synthesizing data obtained from a population or sample.

**Inferential Statistics** - It is the process of estimating information about a population based on the results observed in a sample.

## Relationship between Data Science and Statistics

Statistics provides tools, techniques, and procedures that can be used at all stages of data science projects.

We use statistics at different times within a project. Furthermore, some Machine Learning algorithms are based on statistical foundations.

Statistics can help assess whether an investment fund's success is genuine or due to chance, it can help predict whether a particular subscriber will cancel their subscription this year or whether an insurance claim is fraudulent.

## Statistics for Data Science

Level of knowledge in statistics

**Data Analyst** - Low/medium

**Data Scientist** - High

**Statistical** - Very high

Data scientists have three main characteristics:

1. They have a strong understanding of statistics and machine learning, at least enough to avoid misinterpreting correlation and causation.

2. They have computing and programming skills to carry out analysis work.

3. They can visualize and summarize their data and analysis in a way that is meaningful to someone less familiar with the data.
