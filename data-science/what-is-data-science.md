## Definition of Data Science

Data Science is the term used to define extracting insights from data that is collected from multiple sources.

Using various techniques, including predictive modeling (Machine Learning), Data Science helps analyze and interpret large amounts of data.

The term Data Science appeared at [EMC](www.emc.com) and is gaining popularity every day.

Data Science is the process of extracting valuable information from data. It is a large discipline in itself and consists of specialized skill sets such as: statistics, mathematics, programming, computing and business knowledge, as well as techniques and theories such as predictive analytics, modeling, data mining and visualization.

Data Science has been with us for a long time, in the form of business analysis or competitive intelligence, but only now has its true potential been realized and this is in part due to Big Data.

The main objective of Data Science is to extract and interpret data effectively and present it in a simple language to end users and decision makers.

Thus, Data Science aims to deliver useful information and the ability to convert this information into "data-driven" products!

## Knowledge areas

Data Science is a multidisciplinary area, that is, we need to look for techniques and tools in various areas of knowledge in order to be able to carry out work in Data Science.

### Three pillars of Data Science

**Mathematics and Statistics**

Mathematics and Statistics provide techniques and procedures for calculation, analysis, correlation, transformation, cleaning and interpretation of data.

**Computer Science**

Computer Science provides the tools used in the analysis process, such as computer programming, parallel storage and processing, and optimization of the execution time of analysis processes.

**Knowledge of business areas**

The objective of Data Science is to solve business problems and domain knowledge (business area) is essential to know how to interpret data and the results of the analysis process.

In essence, Data Science involves the use of automated methods (Computer Science) to analyze (Mathematical and Statistical) huge amounts of data in order to extract knowledge (business areas) from the data.

## The Importance of Science in Data Science

The most important part in Data Science is the scientific part; we apply science-based methods, techniques and procedures to analyze data and return results to decision makers.

**Expanding the knowledge area diagram**

- Mathematics
- Statistics
- Advanced Computing
- Visualization
- Data Engineering
- Business Knowledge
- Problems solution
- Scientific Method

Data Science is the exploration and analysis of all available data, whether structured or unstructured, with the aim of developing understanding, extracting knowledge and formulating actions that generate results.

## Data and Decision Making

There is a process where we start with defining a business problem and I then extract the data needed to solve that problem; Decisions will be made based on the results of my analysis and then some actions will be taken.

The job of the Data Science professional is exactly to allow decision makers to make decisions and also actions based on data, that is, to make informed decisions where I can show them, through an analysis process, how it is possible reach a certain result.

#### Example:

**Problem identified:** Customers frequently cancel their telephone plans 2 to 3 months after subscribing to the plan.

**1. Data and Analysis** - Data collected and analyzed led to the conclusion that there is a tendency among telephone operator customers to change operator after the third contact with customer service.

**2. Decision** - The company's executives, based on data, decided to review all customer service processes.

**3. Action** - The company hired a consultancy to provide specialized customer service training, started monitoring calls, created incentive programs for the best operators, etc.

### The Data-Driven process

Basically, we have two ends in the process; we have Data and Action. It is clear that something has to be done along the way and that is where Data Science comes in.

Initially, Data Science will help answer four main questions:

**What happened?**

    A generic question, depending on the business area, I will look for the data, I already have a problem identified, I look at that data, apply the analysis techniques and identify what happened.

    For example, some customers canceled their subscription plan with the telephone company. I found this to be true through the process of analyzing historical data.

**Because it happened?**

    Here I have to apply statistical and mathematical techniques, look for relationships within the data, I have to do this via programming or use some tool that allows data exploration.

    I can use graphs, tables, diagrams to answer why customers canceled their plans with the telephone company.

**Will it happen again?**

    I can answer this question through predictive modeling, Machine Learning.

    I use the knowledge gained in the analysis process, I train the Machine Learning model and make predictions.

**What should be done?**

    Although the decision is made by the executive, the manager, etc. As a data professional, I can suggest a solution/suggestion.

    May I suggest that customers typically cancel after spending a long time on customer service.

Our job is to provide decision-making support. And this entire end-to-end process is what offers value to data analysis.

## Do I need a Bachelor's or Postgraduate degree to work with Data Science?

There are several roles in Data Science:

- Data Scientist
- Data Engineer
- Data Analyst
- Machine Learning Engineer
- AI Engineer
- DataOps Engineer
- Data Architect
- Blockchain Engineer
- RPA developer

These are FUNCTIONS and not PROFESSIONS.

This means that there is no regulation and any professional, with or without a degree, can perform the functions.

**The ideal question would be:** Which undergraduate course could be most useful for working with Data Science?
